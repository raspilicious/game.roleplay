# game.roleplay
A business card-sized RPG written in C++.

I was struck by another bout of inspiration and made another little game for the [Pleasure-not-Business Card RPG Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pleasurecardrpg). This one combines my passions of programming, analogue game design, and roleplaying games! ^_^;

Not only have I uploaded the PDF "card" version of this game, but also a playable build so that you can run it on a Windows computer. And for those who are interested, you can check out the PDF version of the game here: ([game.roleplay() on itch.io](https://aarongoss.itch.io/game-roleplay)), and I've uploaded the entire C++ project to GitHub (you're in it right now!) so you can download the code yourself!

Pro tips: The code in this game works! You could use this game to teach yourself or a friend a tiny bit of coding (using the program structure as a reference), or even keep the card handy for those moments when you're away from a computer and need a little programming kick of endorphins. :>

Enjoy! :)
